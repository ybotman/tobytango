        One of the most unique challenges for beginners in Argentine tango is learning to dance to music that lacks a pronounced drum beat.

          Why Tango Has No Drums

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Unlike many other dance forms (salsa, bachata, ballroom), traditional Argentine tango orchestras 
          typically do not include drums or percussion instruments. Instead, rhythm is created through:

          </ListItem>
        </List>
        
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          This creates a rich, complex rhythmic texture rather than an obvious beat to follow.
