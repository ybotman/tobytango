  // Tango rhythms
  '1-3-': 'The classic tango rhythm. Strong, definitive, and foundational to tango musical interpretation. This rhythm emphasizes beats 1 and 3.',
  '1---': 'The "long note" rhythm. Creates space and dramatic tension in the dance.',
  '----': 'The "pause" or "none" rhythm. Maybe the most express and under-used.',
  '1-34': 'Often used in basic to cross (follower)',
  '123-': 'Very common for intermediate dancers. The first double time',
  '1234': 'The "marcato" rhythm. Every beat is accented, creating consistent drive. This is typically a fast driving beat for tango. It\'s often used in the 3rd \'section\' of 32 bar form (the variation section).',
  '1--4': 'The Phrase Connector.',
  '-2-4': 'The OffBeat rhythm. Emphasizes beats 2 and 4 instead of the traditional strong beats.',
  'Syncopa': 'Accents between main beats (on the "and" counts). Creates a push-pull feeling with dynamic energy.',
  
  // Vals rhythms
  '1--': 'The simplest vals rhythm pattern, emphasizing just the first beat of each measure. This creates a graceful, flowing movement perfect for beginners learning the vals rhythm.',
  '12-': 'A common vals pattern with emphasis on the first and second beats, creating a forward momentum that drives the dance. This pattern helps dancers connect to the waltz-like quality of the music.',
  '1-3': 'A more sophisticated vals pattern emphasizing the first and third beats. This creates a distinctive swing feel that allows for more expressive movements between accents.',
  
  // Milonga rhythms
  'Lisa': 'The most fundamental milonga rhythm, characterized by its clean, simple walking beat. This rhythm provides a stable foundation for the dance, emphasizing strong beats with a steady, grounded feeling.',
  'Traspie': 'A more playful, syncopated milonga rhythm featuring quick-quick-slow patterns. This "double step" adds texture and variety to the dance, creating a bouncy, energetic quality perfect for more expressive movements.',
  'Contratiempo': 'An advanced milonga rhythm that emphasizes the upbeats or spaces between main beats. This off-beat syncopation creates tension and lift in the dance, allowing for sophisticated musical interpretation in the spaces between regular pulses.'
