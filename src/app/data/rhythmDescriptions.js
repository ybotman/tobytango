  '----': 'The "pause" or "none" rhythm. Maybe the most express and under-used.',
  '1-34': 'Often used in basic to cross (follower)',
  '123-': 'Very common for intermediate dancers.  The first double time',
  '1234': 'The "marcato" rhythm. Every beat is accented, creating consistent drive. This is typically a fast driving beat for tango. It\'s often used in the 3rd \'section\' of 32 bar form (the variation section).',
  'Syncopa': 'Accents between main beats (on the "and" counts). Creates a push-pull feeling with dynamic energy.'
